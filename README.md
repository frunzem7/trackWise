`TODO:`

Step 1.1: Define Core Features
Write down the key features you want your habit tracker to have. Start simple and expand later.
Example of core features:
User registration and login (authentication).
Create, update, delete, and view habits.
Track habit progress (e.g., daily check-ins or completion percentage).
Generate analytics (e.g., streaks, success rates).
AI-powered habit recommendations or progress predictions (optional for v1).
Deliverable: A list of core features.


Step 1.2: Outline the Database Schema
Sketch out the structure of your database tables.
Example tables:
Users: Stores user information (e.g., ID, username, email, password hash).
Habits: Stores habit details (e.g., habit ID, user ID, title, description, target frequency).
Habit_Progress: Tracks daily or weekly progress for each habit.
(Optional) Notifications: Stores reminders or milestones for habits.
Deliverable: A draft database schema with table names and fields.


Step 1.3: List the AI Features
Decide which AI features you want to include in the first version.
Example AI features:
Habit recommendations based on user behavior.
Streak predictions based on progress patterns.
Sentiment analysis (if users log thoughts).
Deliverable: A prioritized list of AI features.


Step 1.4: Plan the Kafka Topics
Identify events that Kafka will process.
Example topics:
habit-progress: Sends updates whenever a user checks in on a habit.
notifications: Triggers notifications for reminders or milestones.
(Optional) ai-recommendations: Sends data to the AI service for habit insights.
Deliverable: A list of Kafka topics and their purpose.


Step 1.5: Create a Feature Roadmap
Break your features into versions or milestones to avoid being overwhelmed.
Example:
Version 1: User authentication, habit management, basic analytics.
Version 2: Add AI recommendations and notifications.
Version 3: Full analytics and frontend integration.
Deliverable: A roadmap with priorities.
